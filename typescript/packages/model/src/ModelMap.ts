/**
 * ModelMap will key based on id (if present) otherwise based on object identity.
 *
 * This allows persisted models to be deleted without ever actually loading them.
 *
 * Model reference equality works as we never make a new copy of a model.
 * This might sound crazy -- that the same model is always mutated --
 * but model mutation happens in atomic snapshots.
 *
 * This more accurately reflects reality where a thing is consistent in name
 * over time while being a different instance from moment to moment.
 *
 * Models retain named continuity. The Amazon river is the Amazon river by name through time.
 *
 * This history of its particulate manifestations exist but at a different level
 * of abstraction. These can be retrieved through our transaction log system and
 * a model rolled back to a prior time.
 *
 * Functional programming is getting it backwards by not allowing a thing
 * to be consistent by name. We allow this while still allowing atomic versions of the
 * thing to be retrieved via transaction logs -- and the interdependent state of the universe
 * to be rolled back through those same logs.
