- Inbound Edges
  - Inbound on my id
    - Nonsense. QueryFromID
  - Inbound on my own column
    - Fine. Inbound based on what that column is an id of
  - Inbound on some other type's column
    - Nonsense. Do: `OtherType.queryFromID(id).queryThing()` instead.
      - Could work via:
        - `Self.queryFrom(otherTypeId) ...` which does internal conversion
  - Inbound on junction edge?
    - Nonsense. Do: `OtherType.queryFromID(id).queryThing()` instead.
- Outbound Edges
  - Outbound on my id
    - Nonsense. Would need to know the other table column.
    - Outbound<my id, other type.column> does work though
      - same as: Outbound<other type.column>
  - Outbound on one of my fields
    - Fine. Field edge.
  - Outbound on the other type's field
    - Fine. Foreign key.
  - Outbound on junction edge
    - Fine. `foo.queryBars()`
-
